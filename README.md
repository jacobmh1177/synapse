# Synapse

Synapse is a platform designed to crowdsource, verify, and redistribute information in the aftermath of disaster. It has 3 components: a mobile application, a web app, and an sms service. It was developed as part of Stanford's [CS210](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs210/) and won the Department Award for Best Senior Project in 2017.

Here's what users can do with Synapse:

* Reporting infrastructure changes, aid stations, and more with geolocation and short descriptions
* Verifying or disputing other users reports
* Getting real time, adjusted accuracy scores for existing reports
* Queue actions offline, so that they fire off when network connection is refreshed
* Cache maps of locations ahead of time to be prepared for and save data in a disaster scenario
* An admin overview of the situation with additional functionality from our web app
* Getting vital information from approved organizations in app

We strive to make all of these features consume as little data as possible while being robust.

Here are some of the features that are currently in development:

* Plugging in approved organizations to our web app, which includes reporting that gives a perfect accuracy score and the ability to post to users' newsfeed
* Photo uploads and photo downloads on request
* Continued advancement of our real time verification model
* Adding emergency cards with contact info based on current location
* Keeping track of friends and family in a disaster so you can assure they're safe

Synapse is a great project for people looking to use CS for social good or to tackle difficult problems that are unique to disaster scenarios, and we're always looking for new contributors.
